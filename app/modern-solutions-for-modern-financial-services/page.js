            The last decade has witnessed a leap in financial services marking a shift from rigid traditional systems to digital and agile services. This leap is further pushing banks, FinTech, and telecom providers to adapt and deliver financial services that match the modern lifestyle of modern customers. Only the real challenge isn’t digitization. In 2025, around  2.5 million people remain unbanked and underserved, a staggering number in an era of advancement and technology, and the real pioneers in the industry will be the ones to deliver services that make a difference. At Arkam we believe that access to financial services is a basic right, and we’re on a mission to promote a more connected & accessible financial ecosystem for all. 
          </p>
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>The need for financial tools is staggering, while the obstacles are many. Lack of access is a primary issue, while minimum balance requirements and high fees is another. Documentation and paperwork are also a concern,  while lack of trust in traditional financial systems due to high interest rates and previous bad experiences worsen the problem. Financial services are crucial but also sensitive and people require services that are accessible, simple and affordable.  However, introducing new financial services usually takes months and even years due to fixed, antiquated systems that slow time-to-market. The costs of enhancing and maintaining custom in-house solutions persist in a rise, placing a heavy burden on budgets and internal resources. At the same time, legacy technologies prevent innovation and lead to customer experiences that fall short of today’s presumptions. Managing constantly evolving regulatory requirements adds another layer of complexity, increasing both risk and operational challenges. All resulting in high-fees, low access and compicated procedure.</p>
